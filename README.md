Kayla 
this is me!
I'm in my 5th yr of Neuroscience :brain: #H2
I took this course so I could be an asset in the future teams that I'm on and also get certified in Neurotechnology Innovation *italicized text* #H3
I've always been interested in how the brain works and what secrets it holds to our life and state of being. Neuroscience seemed like the best way to understand this in both a chemical and abstract way! :goggles: :dna: :woman_teacher:
I think biotech is the area I'm leaning towards post-grad, I want to touch some grass and enter the workforce after graduating and then maybe go back to school after! Biotech is the future and I want to be an active part of it :smiling_face-with-open-hands:
